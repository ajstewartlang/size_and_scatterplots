\maketitle

Scatterplots, utilised in scientific communication for a wide variety of tasks,
are some of the most widely used and widely studied data visualizations. Viewers
mostly interpret them in similar ways \cite{kay_heer_2015}, and they are simple
enough to be easily studied while providing important insights into visualization
design, human-computer interaction, and human perception. In a previous study \cite{strain_2023},
we showed that a novel point contrast manipulation, in which the contrast of a certain
scatterplot point was reduced as the size of the point's residual increased, could be
used to partially correct for a systematic underestimation bias present in the
literature \cite{strahan_1978; bobko_1979; cleveland_1982; lane_1985; lauer_1989; 
collyer_1990; meyer_1992]}. We suggested that this was due to the narrowing
of the perceived probability distribution of a particular plot brought
on by the lower contrast (and therefore higher uncertainty) in those outer
areas. We tested linear, non-linear, and non-linear inverted functions relating
point contrast to residual size, finding that the non-linear function produced
the most accurate estimates of correlation, and that the non-linear inverted produced
the least accurate.

Of course, point contrast is not the only available visual feature that might be used
to influence viewer's perceptions of the width of a probability distribution. Instead,
we might use the size of a point. There is evidence in the literature that larger points
are more salient \cite{healey_2012}, can bias judgements of point position
\cite{hong_2021}, and can result in faster reaction times \cite{grice_1983} to
peripherally presented stimuli. In addition, smaller stimuli are associated with
greater levels of spatial uncertainty \cite{alais_2004}, and if increased positional
uncertainty is driving the reduction in error we saw in our previous work \cite{strain_2023},
we would expect a similar effect when point size is used instead of point contrast.

\subsection{Open Research Statement}\label{open-research-statement}}

The experiment was conducted according to the principles of open and reproducible research.
All data and analysis code are available at \url{https://github.com/gjpstrain/size_contrast_and_scatterplots}.
This repository contains instructions for building a docker image to fully
reproduce the computational environment used, allowing for full replications
of stimulus generation, analyses, and the paper itself. The experiment was
pre-registered with the OSF (\url{https://osf.io/k4gd8}).

\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

150 participants were recruited using the Prolific.co platform. Normal to
corrected-to-normal vision and English fluency were required for participation. As in
\cite{strain_2023}, and in accordance with previously published guidelines \cite{peer_2021},
participants were required to have completed at least 100 studies on Prolific, and were
required to have a Prolific score of at least 100, indicating acceptance on at least
100/101 previously completed studies. Participants who took part in any of our
previous studies were prevented from participating, and participants were only
permitted to complete the experiment on a desktop or laptop computer.

Data were collected from 164 participants. 14 failed more than 2 out of 6 attention
check questions, and, as per pre-registration stipulations, were rejected from the study. Data
from 150 participants was included in the analysis (48.00\% male, 50.00\% female, and 2.00\% non-binary). Mean age of participants was 29.56
(\emph{SD} = 8.54). Mean graph literacy score was 21.77
(\emph{SD} = 4.29) out of 30. The average time taken to complete
the experiment was 39 minutes (SD = 14 minutes).

\hypertarget{stimuli}{%
\subsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli}}

The data used to generated the scatterplots in the current study was identical to that
used previously \cite{strain_2023}. Scatterplots were generated based on 45 uniformly distributed \emph{r} values
between 0.2 and 0.99. Scatterplot points were generated based on bivariate normal
distributions with standard deviations of 1 in each direction. Each scatterplot
had a 1:1 aspect ratio, was generated as a 1200 x 1200 pixel .png image, and was
scaled up or down according to the participant's monitor. See \autoref{dot-pitch-and-crowdsourced-experiments}
for a more detailed discussion of precise point sizes and dot pitch in crowd-sourced
experiments.

As in our previous study \cite{strain_2023}, we used equation 1 to map residuals
to point sizes. We used a scaling factor of 4 and a constant of 0.2 to achieve a
minimum point size of 12/13 pixels, which is consistent with the point size on
a 1920 x 1080 monitor for both experiments in \cite{strain_2023}. Again, see \autoref{dot-pitch-and-crowdsourced-experiments}
for a discussion of dot pitch. Scripts detailing scatterplot and mask generation
can be found in the item preparation folder in the repository linked below.

\begin{equation}
  point-size = 1 - b^R
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{dot-pitch-and-crowdsourced-experiments-1}{%
\subsection{Dot Pitch and Crowdsourced Experiments}\label{dot-pitch-and-crowdsourced-experiments-1}}

In our previous study \cite{strain_2023}, we had no way of obtaining dot pitch
or participant to monitor distance due to the online, crowdsourced nature of the
experiments. Since then we have adopted a method for obtaining the height of a
participant's monitor in inches \cite{screenscale}. Combining this with the
monitor resolution fetched from Psychopy and assuming a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio
allows us to infer dot pitch and therefore the physical size of the points in our
experiment. Mean dot pitch was 0.33mm, (\(SD = 0.06\)),
corresponding to a physical size on the screen of 4.32mm
for the smallest points displayed. While dot pitch is not necessary information for the present study, as we are only
interested in the relative differences in correlation estimates between point size
conditions, the fact that we can collect it at all is indicative of the gap
being narrowed with regards to psychophysical testing between in-person and online
experiments. Given that the latter are cheaper, easier, and immeasurably quicker,
anything that can be done be done to narrow this gap in capability is a boon.
See \autoref{results} for analyses including dot pitch as a predictor.

\hypertarget{visual-threshold-testing}{%
\subsection{Visual Threshold Testing}\label{visual-threshold-testing}}

It is key that our manipulation does not functionally removing data from the scatterplot,
thus, in order to test that all our points were visible across a range of viewing
contexts and on a range of apparatus, we included visual threshold testing prior
to the experimental items in the study. Participants were shown six scatterplots
with a number of points, and were asked to enter in a textbox how many points
were being displayed. The points were the same size as the smallest points used
in the experimental materials. 5\% of
participants were correct on 5 out of 6 visual
threshold questions, while 95\% were correct
on 6 out of 6. It should be noted that those
participants scoring 5/6 did not answer incorrectly, rather did not answer
at all for this particular questions, which is more suggestive of either
a mis-click or an initial misunderstanding of the task they were asked to complete.
Regardless, we consider these results to be indicative of a sufficient level of
point visibility for the current experiment.

\hypertarget{design}{%
\subsection{Design}\label{design}}

The experiment used a fully repeated measures, within-participants design, with each
participant seeing and responding to each of the 180 scatterplots in a randomised order.
There were four scatterplots for each of the 45 \emph{r} values corresponding to the
four levels of the size condition, examples of which can be see in Figure \ref{fig:examples}.
Everything needed to run the experiment, including code, materials, instructions, and scripts, is
hosted at \url{https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Strain/exp_size_only}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{size_and_scatterplots_files/figure-latex/examples-1} \caption{Four levels of the point size condition, demonstrated with an \textit{r} value of 0.6}\label{fig:examples}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

Each participants was shown the participants information sheet (PIS) and provided
consent through key presses in response to consent statements. They were asked
to provide their age in a free text box, and their gender identity. Participants
then completed the 5-item Subjective Graph Literacy (SGL) test \cite{garcia_2016},
followed by the visual threshold testing described above. Participants then completed
the screen scaling task described in \autoref{dot-pitch-and-crowdsourced-experiments}.
Participants were given instructions, and then shown examples of \emph{r} = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and
0.95, as in our previous work \cite{strain_2023}. \autoref{training} includes
a discussion of the potential effects of this training. Two practice trials were
given before the experiment began. Participants worked through a series of 180 trials
in which they were asked to use a slider to estimate the correlation shown in
the scatterplot. Interspersed were six attention check trials which asked
participants to set the slider to 1 or 0 and ignore the scatterplot.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

All analyses were conducted using R (version 4.2.3 \cite{r_core}). Models were
built using the \textbf{buildmer} (version 2.8 \cite{voeten_buildmer_2022}) and \textbf{lme4}
(version 1.1-32 \cite{bates_lme4_2015}) packages, with size manipulation being set
as the predictor for participants' errors in correlation estimates

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{size_and_scatterplots_files/figure-latex/dot-plot-1} \caption{Mean error in correlation estimates across the four size manipulation conditions, with 95\% confidence intervals shown.}\label{fig:dot-plot}
\end{figure}

Mean errors in correlation estimates for the four size manipulation conditions
can be seen in figure \ref{fig:dot-plot}. A likelihood ratio test revealed that the
model including size manipulation as a predictor explained significantly more
variance than a null model (\(\chi^2\)(3) = 3,508.84,
\emph{p} \textless{} .001). This model has random intercepts for
items and participants. The effect here is driven by participants' errors being lower
for scatterplots with the non-linear size decay manipulation than for all other conditions,
for error being lower for scatterplots with linear size decay than for plots with
inverted non-linear decay or standard size, and for errors being higher for scatterplots
with standard size than for plots with inverted non-linear decay.

Testing for contrasts between the four levels of the size manipulation condition
were performed with the \textbf{emmeans} package (version 1.8.5 \cite{emmeans}), and
of correlation estimates are shown in Figure \ref{fig:dot-plot}. The \textbf{EMAtools} package
was used to calculate effects sizes in Cohen's d, the results of which can be seen in
Table \ref{tab:effects-df}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In addition, we find no significant difference between the experimental model
and another including graph literacy as a fixed effect (\(\chi^2\)(1)
0.16, \emph{p} = .690).
These results suggest the effect we found was not driven by difference in graph literacy.

\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:changes-with-r-size} shows how participants' mean errors in correlation
estimates change with the objective Pearson's \emph{r} value, plotted separately for each
size decay condition. Note the close-to-zero errors present in the non-linear size
decay condition.
