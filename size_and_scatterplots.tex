The data used to generated the scatterplots in the current study was identical to that
in \cite{strain_2023}. They were generated based on 45 uniformly distributed \emph{r} values
between 0.2 and 0.99. Scatterplot points were generated based on bivariate normal
distributions with standard deviations of 1 in each direction. Each scatterplot
had a 1:1 aspect ratio, was generated as a 1200 x 1200 pixel .png image, and was
scaled up or down according to the participant's monitor. See section \ref{dot-pitch-and-crowdsourced-experiments}
for a more detailed discussion of precise point sizes and dot pitch in crowd-sourced
experiments.

As in our previous study \cite{strain_2023}, we used equation 1 to map residuals
to point sizes. We used a scaling factor of 4 and a constant of 0.2 to achieve a
minimum point size of 12/13 pixels, which is consistent with the point size on
a 1920 x 1080 monitor for both experiments in \cite{strain_2023}. Again, see section \ref{dot-pitch-and-crowdsourced-experiments}
for a discussion of dot pitch. Scripts detailing scatterplot and mask generation
can be found in the item preparation folder in the repository linked below.

\begin{equation}
  point-size = 1 - b^R

The experiment was conducted according to the principles of open and reproducible research.
All data and analysis code are available at \url{https://github.com/gjpstrain/size_contrast_and_scatterplots}.
This repository contains instructions for building a docker image to fully
reproduce the computational environment used, allowing for full replications
of stimulus generation, analyses, and the paper itself. The experiment was
pre-registered with the OSF (\url{https://osf.io/k4gd8}).

\hypertarget{participants}{%

\subsection{Design}\label{design}}

The experiment used a fully repeated measures, within-participants design, with each
participant seeing and responding to each of the 180 scatterplots in randomised order.
There were four scatterplots for each of the 45 \emph{r} values corresponding to the
four levels of the size condition, examples of which can be see in figure \ref{plot-examples}.
